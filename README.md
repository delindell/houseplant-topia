# Houseplant-Topia!

## Description

Keeping track of houseplants can be difficult. With different watering schedules, locations, and tendencies just being a few of the factors that can lead to unfortunate accidents (death).  I wanted to make an app that allowed users to keep track of these plants, through various means, even getting reminders to water them. 

* Full CRUD capability on the plant and rooms in their home
* Built using ReactJS using various aspects of the framework to improve the user experience\
* ReactRouter to route the user to specific pages of the app
* Reactstrap used for modals
* Styling was accomplished using SCSS
* Icons gathered from FontAwesome
* Data storage and user authentication were accomplished using FirebaseÂ 
* Created a Node.js server via Heroku and integrated Twilio's API to allow the user to receive SMS text alerts when a specific plant needs to be watered
